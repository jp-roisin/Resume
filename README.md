# My resume

## Introduction
This repository serves as a centralized hub for my professional resume, enabling me to easily manage its progression and port it across multiple platforms. By maintaining my resume here, I ensure that the most up-to-date and polished version is readily available. Making it public on GitHub not only facilitates easy access but also allows for seamless collaboration, feedback, and sharing.

## Choice of LaTeX for Resume Building
I've opted for LaTeX to build my resume for a couple of practical reasons. Back when I taught mathematics, LaTeX was my go-to tool for crafting clear and precise documents. Its knack for handling complex mathematical content made it a natural choice. Now, when it comes to resumes, I appreciate LaTeX's ability to create clean and straightforward layouts.
